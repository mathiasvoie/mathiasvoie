<h2>Hey, I'm Mathias! ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>
Iâ€™m a passionate developer from Norway, and my journey in development began in 2016. I have a strong interest in creating useful, engaging, and well-crafted software. At the moment, I spend much of my time working with React, TypeScript, and Lua, building everything from web applications to game-related tools. Every now and then, I also enjoy developing custom resources for FiveM, combining creativity with technical problem-solving to enhance the gaming experience for players.

<p>
Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Junior Developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://iris-salten.no/">Iris Salten</a>, where I contribute to building effective digital tools designed to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient for employees. Our solutions not only streamline workflows within the organization but, on occasion, also provide valuable services to third parties, helping them work smarter and achieve better results.

<p>
When Iâ€™m not working at Iris Salten, youâ€™ll most likely find me immersed in one of my side projects. These are usually driven by my personal interests, curiosity, or a desire to improve existing ideas, tools, and workflows. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, exploring creative solutions, and building things that I believe can make a difference,whether for myself, others, or the community.
